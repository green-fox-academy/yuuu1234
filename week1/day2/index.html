                     I love to design complex systems with high levels od automation
                    including AI and ribotics. I'm deeply interested in inventing new things that can augment human experience.

                    Everthing I've done, everthing I'll do today, everything I'll ever do. I do to protect this world. Some once told me that with great power comes great probability.
